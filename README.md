# SortPackage
Sort Package Coding Example

This is my submission of the Sort Package Technical Challenge.

The code is fairly basic and first checks inputs for correct values, returns errors if any issues with inputs, and then performs the logic to return the correct Sort for the Package.

Best,
Ron
